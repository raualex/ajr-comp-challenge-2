Description and Notes:

In this comp challenge, I made a basic, introductory page to Goth music, spanning several subgenre styles.  I selected the 8 most important artists in discovering the genre and gave links to their websites and a recommendation of the album to start, were sopmeone to be interested in the group (as well as the number of other releases they have listed below them).  For my color scheme, I really kept in mind gthe spirit and imagery of Goth music and art, and kept my colors to the basics: black and white.  To accent these, I used a couple of shades of lighter gray to break up the monotony of that, and added a dark gold as a splash color to match the comp.  I used CSS Grid on the artist cards, and, otherwise, used flex inside the cards and on every other container on the page.  All of the links on the page work and will lead you to active websites, opened in new windows.
